# final-project

• The project presents a web application that connects secondary school female students with women from an array of industries, providing them with free career support and mentoring to aid in the career development of women from a young age. 

• It was designed to give young women the opportunity to gain a better understanding of the many career paths available to them, allowing them to make more informed decisions about their future.

• In order to ensure the application was secure and stable, I used MongoDB for the database, Express as the backend server, React for the frontend, and Node.js to facilitate communication between the two. I also used Socket.io to enable real-time communication between users, and Bootstrap and CSS for styling.
