<p> <strong>How this works:</strong> </p>
<p> We run an open mentoring network that connects high school female students with women from an array of industries for free career support 
and mentoring to aid in the career development of women from a young age. When you register you are asked to choose how you would like to 
register, as a mentor or mentee. Once you are registered (as a mentee) you can look through the list of registered mentors in out database 
and join a chat with them. We are aiming to add more features in the future :)</p>
<p> <strong> Path </strong> takes serious responsibility to safeguard and promote the welfare of children by following best 
practice guidance on safeguarding to create this safeguarding policy and including safeguarding features into its mentoring platform. </p>
<p> The term 'mentee' refers to teenagers who have signed up and been accepted onto the Platform. </p>
<p> Our platform aims to ensure that all persons, in particular teenagers, using Path services can do safely, free from abuse and any form of discrimination. </p>
<p> <strong> The Platform has been designed for: </strong> </p>
<p> -Only mentors who currently work within the UK can sign up and register on the Platform. </p>
<p> -Mentors must have an active secondary school email address and without this email address they cannot register on the Platform as they need to be verified; </p>
<p> -Before fully registering, mentors must complete an onboarding process on the Platform which includes training on safeguarding responsibilities and reporting procedures;</p>
<p> -Any mentee or mentor who does not comply with out Terms and Conditions, will be suspended. Relevant authorities will be contacted if required by law. </p>
